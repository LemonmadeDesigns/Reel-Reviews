## Description

The Movie Search App is a web application designed to help users search for movies by their titles. What sets this app apart is its ability to categorize and rate movies based on genre and age group. Users can enter the name of a movie they are interested in, and the app will fetch and display a list of matching movie titles from a movie database. Additionally, it categorizes these movies into genres and age ratings, providing a comprehensive movie search experience.

## Technology Stack

- React for the front-end
- Node.js for the back-end
- Bootstrap for styling
- The Movie Database (TMDb) API for movie data
