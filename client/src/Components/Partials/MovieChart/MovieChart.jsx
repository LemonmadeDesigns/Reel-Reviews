        <aside>
          <h3>
            Children (Under 11): <span style={{ color: "#fd1892" }}>Gen Alpha</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            For children, the app would likely focus on movies rated G or PG, emphasizing themes of adventure, fantasy,
            and family-friendly content. The selections would avoid complex or mature themes, aligning with what is
            generally considered appropriate and enjoyable for this age group.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Teenagers (12 - 29): <span style={{ color: "#2c90fc" }}>Gen Z</span>{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Teenagers often seek movies that resonate with their experiences or aspirations, including genres like young
            adult fiction, comedies, and action-packed adventures. The app can curate movies that tackle coming-of-age
            themes, first loves, or the challenges of growing up, which are particularly appealing to this demographic.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Young Adults (30 - 44); <span style={{ color: "#b8fd33" }}>Millennials</span>{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Young adults might appreciate a wider range of movies, including those that address more mature and complex
            themes. This age group might be drawn to genres like psychological thrillers, romantic comedies, indie
            films, and dramas that reflect their own life experiences or societal issues they care about.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Adults (45 - 59): <span style={{ color: "#fec837" }}>Gen X</span>{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Adults may have more eclectic tastes, ranging from critically acclaimed dramas and documentaries to action
            and suspense. They might also appreciate films that delve into familial dynamics, career challenges, and
            personal growth, reflecting the broader range of life stages and experiences typical of this age group.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Seniors (60+): 
            <span style={{ color: "#b827fc" }}> Baby Boomers,</span>{" "}

            <span style={{ color: "#29fc92" }}> Greatest Generation</span>{" "}
          </h3>
          <p>
            Seniors might enjoy movies that offer nostalgia, historical perspectives, or thoughtful reflections on life
            and relationships. Films that feature characters in similar life stages or that revisit eras from their
            youth can be particularly appealing, offering both entertainment and a connection to their own lives and
            memories.
